Spawning fish struggle to navigate past human-made barriers like dams, disrupting ecosystems. The ‘fish door-
bell’ system in Utrecht, Netherlands, uses a live camera feed to allow tourists and viewers to open the dam when they see fish. However, this framework requires constant human monitoring. Our approach, DORI (Detection of River In-habitants), seeks to replace this with an automated system that detects and classifies fish, signaling the dam to open autonomously. We optimize the runtime and performance of the algorithm by integrating and testing the fish detection performance of the state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as Segment Anything Model (SAM), Fast Segment Anything (FastSAM), Recognize Anything Model (RAM), Tag2Text and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) for image segmentation and classification in the DORI frame-work.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
