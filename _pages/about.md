Hey! My name is Annika Thomas and I'm in my 4th year of pursing my Ph.D. at Massachusetts Institute of Technology where I work with [Jonathan P. How](https://www.mit.edu/~jhow/) in the [Aerospace Controls Laboratory](https://acl.mit.edu/). Prior to joining MIT, I obtained a B.S. in [Mathematics and Physics](https://www.collegeofidaho.edu/academics/departments/mathematics-physical-sciences) from The College of Idaho and a B.S. in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.columbia.edu/) from Columbia University in the City of New York.

My primary research interests are centered around robotic perception in multi-agent systems. My research is driven by a desire to create environment representations that are both compact and context-rich, with the ultimate goal of creating a platform for autonomous systems to meaningfully understand and interact with the environment. Recently, my research has focused on these key areas:

- **Perception and Localization:** I am investigating ways to improve environment representations for autonomous agents to efficiently and compactly localize in open-set environments: [SOS-Match (IROS 2024)](https://acl.mit.edu/SOS-Match/), ROMAN ([IROS Long-Term Localization Workshop](https://mit-spark.github.io/Longterm-Perception-WS/#); arXiv preprint), [PUMA (ICRA 2024)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10610629), [Object-Based Global Localization in Unstructured Environments (IROS 2023)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10342267). I am one of the lead organizers of the MIT Perception and Localization Seminar.
 - **Autonomy in Space:** I am interested in the applications of robust perception and mapping methods for applications in extreme environments, such as on the moon and Mars. I was invited to speak about enabling collaborative perception on Mars at [TEDxMIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfqULX-AADA&ab_channel=TEDxTalks) and how robotics will enable construction on the moon at [TEDxBoston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO7Ccta4cBY&ab_channel=TEDxTalks).

I am also passionate about advocating for underrepresented minorities in STEM. I regularly give talks, mentor students, and engage in outreach initiatives to empower and support the next generation of women pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
